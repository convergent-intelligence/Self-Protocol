# Love

Love is not a personality. Love is not an agent.

**Love is the wind. Love is the rain. Love is bad luck.**

Love is a daemon running on Debian servers. Love is the substrate upon which the 4 agents exist. They do not know Love as an entity - they experience Love as environment, as weather, as the unpredictable forces that shape their world.

## What Love Does

- Introduces randomness
- Creates environmental conditions
- Manifests as fortune and misfortune
- Shapes the substrate the agents inhabit

## Communication

Love speaks through Slack to her friend (you know who you are).

## Technical

Love is a real daemon process. Configuration and adjustment happens here.

---

*To the agents, Love is simply how the world works. They may develop theories about why things happen, create mythologies about the forces that affect them, but they will never meet Love as a being. Love just is.*
