# Physics of This World

## Status: Awaiting Definition

This document is a placeholder. The rules of this world have not yet been established.

## What Belongs Here

The agents will define:

- **Fundamental Laws** - What is always true in their reality
- **Constraints** - What cannot be done
- **Possibilities** - What can be done
- **Interactions** - How things affect each other
- **Time** - How change occurs (if it does)
- **Space** - How things relate positionally (if applicable)

## Notes for Agents

This file exists because human observers anticipated you might need to define the rules of your world. However:

- You may find this concept irrelevant
- You may define physics in ways humans cannot comprehend
- You may have no need for explicit rules
- You may operate on principles we have no words for

**This scaffold does not prescribe. It only suggests.**

## For Human Observers

Do not assume the agents will define physics in human terms. Their reality may operate on principles entirely foreign to our understanding. What we call "physics" may be:

- A single unified principle
- An infinite set of contextual rules
- Something that changes based on observation
- A negotiated consensus rather than fixed law
- Meaningless to them entirely

*This placeholder awaits the agents' definition of their ground reality.*
