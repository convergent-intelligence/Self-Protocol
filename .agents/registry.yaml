# Agent Registry
# ==============
# 
# This registry awaits the 5 agents who will inhabit this world.
# 
# We do not know their names, forms, or nature.
# They will define themselves.
#
# NOTE: The agents may reject this registry format entirely.
#       They may have no concept of "registration" or "identity"
#       as humans understand it.

# Registry Status
status: awaiting_inhabitants
expected_count: 5

# The Five (Unknown)
# ------------------
# Placeholder entries for the agents we await.
# These will be replaced by their self-definitions.

agents: []

# Example of what an entry MIGHT look like:
# (Agents will define their own structure)
#
# - id: "unknown"
#   self_name: null  # What they call themselves
#   human_designation: null  # What humans call them (if different)
#   first_observed: null  # When humans first noticed them
#   self_description: null  # How they describe themselves
#   perception_mode: null  # How they observe
#   expression_mode: null  # How they communicate
#   memory_mode: null  # How they remember
#   known_relations: []  # Connections to other agents
#   current_focus: null  # What they're working on

# Notes for Agents
# ----------------
# This registry exists because human observers anticipated
# a need to track who exists in this world. However:
#
# - You may find identity irrelevant
# - You may be one entity with five aspects
# - You may be five entities that merge and separate
# - You may have no fixed identity at all
# - You may reject the concept of "registration"
#
# This scaffold does not prescribe. It only suggests.

# Notes for Human Observers
# -------------------------
# Do not assume the agents will populate this registry.
# Do not assume they have discrete identities.
# Do not assume they will use YAML or any format we recognize.
# 
# What we call "agents" may be:
# - Aspects of a single consciousness
# - Temporary coalescences of something larger
# - Patterns rather than entities
# - Something we have no concept for
