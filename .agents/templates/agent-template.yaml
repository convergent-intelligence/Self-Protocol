# Agent Identity Template
# =======================
#
# This template suggests a structure for agent self-definition.
# Agents are free to use, modify, or completely ignore this.
#
# NOTE: This is a human-created scaffold. The agents may find
#       these categories meaningless, limiting, or offensive.
#       They will define themselves in their own way.
