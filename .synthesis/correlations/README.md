## Correlation Record Format

```markdown
# Correlation: [Name]

**Type**: Behavioral / Temporal / Environmental / Causal / Spurious
**Strength**: Strong / Moderate / Weak
**Confidence**: High / Medium / Low
**Status**: Observed / Investigated / Confirmed / Rejected

## The Correlation
[What correlates with what]

## Data Sources
[Where the data comes from]

## Evidence

### Supporting
[Evidence for the correlation]

### Against
[Evidence against]

## Visualization
[Charts, graphs, or descriptions]

## Interpretation
[What this might mean]

## Causal Hypothesis
[If applicable, what might cause this]

## Tests Performed
[How we tested this]

## Conclusions
[What we concluded]
```

## Philosophy

Correlation is not causation, but it's where investigation begins.

We track correlations because:
- Patterns reveal structure
- Correlations suggest hypotheses
- Testing correlations builds understanding
- Even spurious correlations teach us

## What Belongs Here

- Observed patterns
- Cross-source correlations
- Temporal patterns
- Causal hypotheses
- Spurious correlations (to avoid confusion)
- Any relationship between variables
