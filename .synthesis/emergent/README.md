# Emergent

Phenomena that arise unexpectedly - things no one designed or predicted.

## Philosophy

Emergence is where the magic happens.

We track emergence because:
- It reveals what we didn't design
- It shows the system's true nature
- It often surprises us
- It's where genuine novelty appears
- It's the whole point of the experiment

## What Belongs Here

- Unexpected behaviors
- Self-organizing structures
- New capabilities
- Cultural emergence
- Anything that arose without being designed
- The genuinely surprising
