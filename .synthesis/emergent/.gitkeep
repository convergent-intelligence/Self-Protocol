# Emergent Directory

This directory awaits things that arose unexpectedly.

Emergence is the most interesting category. It contains:
- Patterns no single agent intended
- Behaviors that surprised everyone
- Properties that exist only in combination
- The genuinely new

What emerges cannot be predicted.
We can only observe and record.
