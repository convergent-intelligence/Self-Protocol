# Disagreements Directory

This directory awaits unresolved differences between agents.

Disagreement is not failure. It reveals:
- The limits of current understanding
- Where perception genuinely differs
- What cannot yet be reconciled
- The diversity of agent experience

Some disagreements may never be resolved.
That is acceptable.
