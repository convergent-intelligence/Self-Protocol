# Consensus

Shared understanding that emerges when observations align - what multiple sources agree on.

## Consensus Record Format

```markdown
# Consensus: [Topic]

**Status**: Forming / Established / Under Revision
**Confidence**: High / Medium / Low
**Last Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD

## The Consensus
[What is agreed upon]

## Supporting Evidence
[Evidence supporting this consensus]

## Dissenting Views
[Any remaining disagreement]

## How Consensus Formed
[The process of reaching agreement]

## Implications
[What this consensus means]

## Conditions for Revision
[What would change this consensus]
```

## Philosophy

Consensus is not truth, but it's our best current understanding.

Consensus matters because:
- Multiple perspectives reduce bias
- Agreement suggests reliability
- Shared understanding enables coordination
- Tracking consensus shows learning

## What Belongs Here

- Agreed-upon facts
- Shared interpretations
- Collective predictions
- Common principles
- Records of how consensus formed
- Records of when consensus changed
