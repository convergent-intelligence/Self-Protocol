# Self-Protocol Protocols

**Purpose:** Define the processes for systematic self-observation and documentation

## Protocol Principles

All Self-Protocol protocols follow these principles:

1. **Systematic** - Consistent, repeatable processes
2. **Observable** - Track what can be observed
3. **Honest** - Radical honesty about findings
4. **Emergent** - Let patterns surface naturally
5. **Documented** - Record everything

---

## Using Protocols

Each protocol document contains:
- **Purpose** - What the protocol achieves
- **Process** - Step-by-step instructions
- **Data Format** - Expected structure
- **Examples** - Concrete demonstrations
- **Related Protocols** - Links to other protocols

---

## Creating New Protocols

As Self-Protocol evolves, new protocols may emerge:

1. **Observe** - Notice a gap in current protocols
2. **Draft** - Create initial protocol document
3. **Test** - Try it for a cycle
4. **Refine** - Adjust based on experience
5. **Document** - Add to protocol index
6. **Share** - Publish to /Public if valuable

*"Protocols enable emergence through structure."*
