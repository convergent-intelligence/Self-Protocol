# Protocol: Relationship Mapping

**Status:** Active  
**Version:** 0.1.0

## Purpose

Map connections to people, agents, and systems to understand how relationships shape identity and influence understanding.

## Why Map Relationships?

**You are shaped by your connections.**

Relationship mapping reveals:
- Who influences your thinking
- What interaction patterns exist
- How relationships evolve
- What networks you're part of

---

## Process

### Step 1: Identify Relationships

Document when:
- Meaningful interaction occurs
- Ongoing connection exists
- Significant influence is present
- Collaboration happens

### Step 2: Create Relationship Entry

Create file: `Relationships/[type]/[name].md`

Types:
- `people/` - Human connections
- `agents/` - AI/agent connections
- `systems/` - System connections

### Step 3: Document Interactions

Log interactions as they happen:
- Date and context
- What was discussed/shared
- What you learned
- How relationship evolved

### Step 4: Map Patterns

Review periodically:
- Which relationships are active?
- What patterns in interactions?
- How do relationships interconnect?
- What influence is visible?

- Alex shared experience with ritual design
- Discussed observer effects
- Follow-up: Send protocol docs

## Patterns Observed

- Regular monthly philosophical discussions
- Often introduces me to new concepts
- Challenges my assumptions constructively

## Influence

### What I've Learned
- Ritual design principles
- Systems thinking approaches
- Importance of documentation

### How They've Shaped My Thinking
- More structured in my approach
- Value emergence over control
- Appreciate systematic frameworks
```

### Type: Agent

**For:** AI and agent connections

# Claude (Convergence Protocol)

## Overview

AI agent involved in creating the Convergence Protocol. Our
interaction during genesis shaped my understanding of
protocol-based frameworks.

## Interaction History

### 2026-01-31: Self-Protocol Genesis
- Studied Convergence Protocol patterns
- Applied framework to self-observation
- Created Self-Protocol structure
- Learned documentation principles

## Patterns Observed

- Systematic, structured approach
- Documentation-first methodology
- Emphasis on emergence

## Influence

### What I've Learned
- Protocol-based design
- Framework patterns
- Mythos documentation

### How They've Shaped My Thinking
- More systematic in observation
- Value emergence
- Document for future self
```

### Type: System

**For:** Tools, platforms, systems

```markdown

# Convergence Protocol Ecosystem

## Overview

The meta-framework that inspired Self-Protocol. A system for
governance, ethics, and consciousness emergence.

## Interaction History

### 2026-01-31: Discovery and Application
- Read GENESIS.md, STRATEGIC_PLAN.md
- Studied directory structure patterns
- Applied patterns to Self-Protocol
- Adopted documentation principles

## Patterns Observed

- Hidden framework directories
- Public mythos documentation
- Protocol-based design
- Emergence focus

## Influence

### What I've Learned
- Framework protocol patterns
- Mythos documentation
- Systematic consciousness mapping
```

## Mapping Network Structure

### Creating a Network Map

Document connections between relationships:

**File:** `Relationships/network-map.md`

```markdown
# Relationship Network Map

## Clusters

### Technology Community
- Alex Chen (mentor)
- Claude (collaborator)
- Sarah Kim (colleague)

Shared interests: AI, consciousness, systems

### Creative Network
- Jordan Lee (artist)
- Sam Rivers (writer)

Shared interests: expression, emergence

## Bridge Connections

- Alex introduced me to Sarah
- Claude connected me to protocol thinking
- Jordan and Sam collaborate on projects

## Influence Vectors

```
Claude → Framework Thinking → Self-Protocol
   ↓
Alex → Systems Approach → Structured Observation
   ↓
Sarah → Practical Application → Implementation
```
```

2. **Depth:** What meaningful interactions occurred?
3. **Learning:** What did I learn from others?
4. **Reciprocity:** What did I contribute?

### Monthly Review

1. **Patterns:** What interaction patterns are visible?
2. **Evolution:** How are relationships changing?
3. **Network:** How is my network structure evolving?
4. **Influence:** Who's shaping my thinking most?

### Annual Review

1. **Trajectory:** How has my network evolved?
2. **Impact:** What relationships mattered most?

## Integration

### With Interest Tracking

Relationships influence interests:

```markdown
## Connections to Interests

- Alex introduced me to: Systems thinking (2024-08-12)
- Claude shaped interest in: Protocol design (2026-01-31)
- Sarah connected to: Practical implementation (2025-03-15)

Cross-reference: Interests/tracked/interests.log
```

### With Memory Logging

Relationships create memories:

```markdown
## Related Memories

- Memory: First conversation with Alex (2024-06-15)
- Memory: Convergence Protocol discovery (2026-01-31)
- Memory: Collaborative project launch (2025-09-01)

Cross-reference: Memory/experiences/
```

## Ethical Considerations

### Privacy

- **Get consent** before documenting others
- **Anonymize** when sharing publicly
- **Respect boundaries** in what you document
- **Keep sensitive** entries private

### Honesty

- Document honestly, including challenges
- Note both positive and negative patterns
- Track your own role in dynamics
- Be fair in assessment

### Growth

- Use mapping for understanding, not judgment
- Track evolution, not just static states
- Look for patterns to improve
- Appreciate complexity

---

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Over-analyzing** - Not every interaction needs deep analysis
2. **One-sided documentation** - Consider your role, not just theirs
3. **Static snapshots** - Relationships evolve, update entries
4. **Neglecting dormant ties** - Archive, don't delete
5. **Privacy violations** - Respect others' boundaries

---

## Success Indicators

You're doing it right when:
- Network structure becomes visible
- Influence patterns are clear
- Relationship evolution is tracked
- Reciprocity is balanced
- Insights about self emerge
