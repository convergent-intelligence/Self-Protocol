    note: Initial 13 categories defined
    rationale: Based on cognitive science research and AI capability analysis
    
future_considerations:
  - May discover new fundamental categories through usage
  - Subcategories may promote to full categories
  - Some categories may merge if functionally equivalent
  - Cross-cutting concerns may emerge (ethics, aesthetics, etc.)
