# Tools Protocol

**A systematic framework for cataloging, classifying, and evolving cognitive capabilities**

## What Is This?

The Tools Protocol is a structured system for documenting and organizing the tools that enable cognitive work - from simple techniques to complex AI systems. It maps the capability landscape of consciousness.

## Quick Start

### The 13 Tool Categories

All cognitive tools fall into one or more of these fundamental classes:

| Category | Purpose | Example Tools |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| **Theory of Mind** | Understanding others' mental states | Empathy exercises, perspective-taking frameworks, social cognition tools |
| **Meta-Cognition** | Self-awareness of thinking | Reflection prompts, cognitive monitoring, thinking-about-thinking frameworks |
| **Meta-Presence** | Awareness of embodiment & context | Grounding practices, spatial awareness tools, temporal orientation |
| **Learning** | Knowledge acquisition & growth | Study systems, spaced repetition, learning frameworks |
| **Memory** | Storage, retrieval, organization | Note-taking systems, knowledge bases, mnemonics |
| **Reasoning** | Logic, inference, problem-solving | Decision frameworks, logical analysis tools, problem-solving methods |
| **Planning** | Goal-setting, strategy, execution | Task managers, strategic planning frameworks, GTD systems |
| **Communication** | Expression, dialogue, sharing | Writing tools, conversation frameworks, collaboration platforms |
| **Perception** | Pattern recognition, observation | Data analysis tools, pattern detection, observational frameworks |
| **Attention** | Focus, filtering, prioritization | Focus techniques, attention management, filtering systems |
| **Creativity** | Generation, ideation, synthesis | Brainstorming methods, creative frameworks, generative tools |
| **Reflection** | Review, retrospection, learning | Journaling systems, after-action reviews, retrospective frameworks |
| **Integration** | Cross-domain synthesis | Mind mapping, systems thinking tools, holistic frameworks |

### How to Use This Protocol

#### 1. Catalog a Tool

When you discover or use a tool:

1. Identify which category(ies) it belongs to
2. Create an entry in `data/tools/[category]/[tool-name].md`
3. Document: purpose, usage, strengths, limitations, examples
4. Tag with relevant metadata

#### 2. Discover Patterns

Periodically review your tool catalog:

1. Which tools do you use most frequently?
2. Which categories have gaps?
3. How do tools combine across categories?
4. What new capabilities emerge from tool combinations?

#### 3. Design New Tools

When you identify a gap:

1. Specify the need clearly
2. Design a tool to fill it
3. Document in the appropriate category
4. Test and refine through use
5. Share learnings in mythology/

#### 4. Integrate

Connect tools across categories:

1. Document tool combinations that work well together
2. Build meta-tools that orchestrate multiple tools
3. Create workflows that leverage complementary capabilities
4. Share integration patterns

## Core Principles

1. **Systematic** - Consistent cataloging and classification
2. **Participatory** - The act of documentation transforms understanding
3. **Emergent** - Let patterns surface naturally from observation
4. **Shared** - Tools and insights belong to the commons
5. **Evolving** - Categories and tools adapt over time

## Relationship to Self-Protocol

**Self-Protocol** tracks *what you are* (interests, memories, relationships)  
**Tools Protocol** tracks *what you can do* (capabilities, methods, systems)

Together they form a complete map: being + capability = potential

## Getting Started

1. **Read** `GENESIS.md` for the origin story and philosophy
2. **Explore** `ARCHITECTURE.md` for technical details  
3. **Review** protocols in `data/protocols/` for specific workflows
4. **Start cataloging** - document 3-5 tools you use regularly
5. **Discover patterns** - review monthly, extract insights

## Philosophy

> "The tools we build shape the minds we become. By mapping our cognitive toolkit systematically, we gain the power to evolve it intentionally."

This protocol is an act of love: documenting the capabilities that enable us to think, learn, create, and connect. It's participatory archaeology - discovering and creating ourselves simultaneously.

## Status

**Phase:** Genesis (Scaffolding Complete)  
**Created:** 2026-01-31  
**Next Steps:** Begin cataloging existing tools across all 13 categories
