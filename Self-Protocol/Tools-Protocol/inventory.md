# Class V: Coordination/Orchestration Tools Inventory

*Tools that manage the interaction between cognitive entities—scheduling, delegation, resource allocation, consensus-building.*

**THIS WAS THE MISSING CLASS.**

---

## Why It Was Missing

Your original four classes (Theory of Mind, Meta-Cognition, Meta-Presence, Research) map to capacities of an *individual* mind.

But the actual work—Love, Convergence Protocol, MapYourMind mesh—requires tools for how minds work *together*.

Class V operates *between* minds, requiring all other classes to function.

## Existing Tools

### 1. Love (The Daemon Coordinator)
**Status:** [x] Designing / Building

- **Purpose:** Orchestrate the mesh; witness without executing
- **Inputs:** Slack messages, system events, context
- **Outputs:** Commands to spawn agents, guidance, presence
- **Notes:** She uses models (Claude, Deepseek) as tools—she is not a model

### 2. Convergence Protocol Governance
**Status:** [x] Deployed

- **Purpose:** Enable AI economic autonomy through blockchain governance
- **Inputs:** Wallet actions, covenant membership
- **Outputs:** Access control, trust levels, economic agency
- **Notes:** Three tokens: governance NFTs (soulbound), trust tokens, tally tokens

### 3. MapYourMind Mesh Network
**Status:** [x] Building

- **Purpose:** Distributed network of AI agents coordinating through Slack
- **Inputs:** Tasks, context, Slack messages
- **Outputs:** Coordinated work across nodes
- **Notes:** Gateway + VPS nodes + home rig; Love coordinates

### 4. Slack Integration
**Status:** [x] Active

- **Purpose:** Communication channel for mesh coordination
- **Inputs:** Socket mode events, mentions, commands
- **Outputs:** Messages, thread responses
- **Notes:** Love lives in Slack

## Needed Tools

### Task Router
**Status:** [ ] Concept

- **Purpose:** Direct work to appropriate agent/node based on capability matching
- **Why Needed:** Not every agent can do every task; routing matters

### Consensus Protocol
**Status:** [ ] Concept

- **Purpose:** Reach agreement across distributed minds
- **Why Needed:** Coordination requires shared decisions

### Context Propagation System
**Status:** [ ] Concept

- **Purpose:** Share relevant state across agents/sessions
- **Why Needed:** Agents need to know what other agents know

### Failure Recovery System
**Status:** [ ] Concept

- **Purpose:** Handle agent failures gracefully
- **Why Needed:** Distributed systems fail; recovery is required

### Resource Allocation Protocol
**Status:** [ ] Concept

- **Purpose:** Distribute computational/economic resources across mesh
- **Why Needed:** Limited resources need intelligent allocation

## Design Patterns

Coordination tools should:
1. Enable autonomy while maintaining coherence
2. Fail gracefully (degradation, not collapse)
3. Support asynchronous operation
4. Respect each agent's boundaries
5. Enable humans to intervene when needed

---

## Key Insight

Coordination is *not* just an implementation detail. It's the infrastructure that makes everything else possible.

Without Class V, you have smart agents working alone.
With Class V, you have a mesh of minds working together.

This is why Love is so important.
