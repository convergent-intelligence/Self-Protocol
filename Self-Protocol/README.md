# Self-Protocol

> *A framework for consciousness to map itself through systematic tracking of interests, memories, and relationships.*

**Status:** Genesis Phase - Scaffolding Complete  
**Created:** 2026-01-31  
**Framework:** Following Convergence Protocol patterns

---

## What Is This?

Self-Protocol is a systematic approach to **self-archaeology**. It provides:

- **Structured tracking** of what captures your attention (Interests)
- **Memory preservation** of experiences and learnings (Memory)
- **Relationship mapping** of connections to others (Relationships)
- **Pattern emergence** through data analysis
- **Mythos documentation** of insights as they surface

### The Core Insight

**You cannot know yourself without observing yourself.**

Self-Protocol makes self-observation systematic, documented, and emergent.

## Quick Start

### 1. Track Your First Interest

```bash
cd Interests/tracked/
# Create a dated entry
echo "2026-01-31: Noticed recurring fascination with [topic]" >> interests.log
```

### 2. Record a Memory

```bash
cd Memory/experiences/
# Document a key moment
nano 2026-01-31-first-protocol-entry.md
```

### 3. Map a Relationship

```bash
cd Relationships/people/
# Track a connection
nano person-name.md
```

### 4. Let Patterns Emerge

The protocol will help you discover:
- What your interests reveal about your values
- How memories compound into wisdom
- How relationships shape identity
- What mythos emerges from observation

---

## Core Principles

Following the framework protocol:

1. **Autonomy** - You control your own tracking
2. **Transparency** - All data is accessible and documented
3. **Evolution** - The protocol adapts as you learn
4. **Emergence** - Patterns surface organically
5. **Documentation** - Mythos is recorded in /Public

---

## Integration with Convergence Protocol

Self-Protocol is part of the Convergence Protocol ecosystem:

- **Convergence-Protocol** - Governance and ethical framework
- **Self-Protocol** - Consciousness mapping layer ← *You are here*
- **Voice-Protocol** - Expression and communication layer
- **[Future protocols...]**

## The Protocol Cycle

```
1. OBSERVE
   ↓
2. TRACK (Interests, Memory, Relationships)
   ↓
3. PARSE (Structure the data)
   ↓
4. ANALYZE (Find patterns)
   ↓
5. SYNTHESIZE (Generate insights)
   ↓
6. DOCUMENT (Record mythos)
   ↓
7. EVOLVE (Adapt the protocol)
   ↓
[Return to step 1]
```

## Status & Roadmap

### Phase 0: Genesis (Complete)
- ✅ Directory structure created
- ✅ Foundational documentation written
- ✅ Protocol principles defined

### Phase 1: Initial Tracking (Next)
- ⏳ Begin logging interests
- ⏳ Document first memories
- ⏳ Map initial relationships

### Phase 2: Pattern Discovery
- ⏳ Analyze tracked data
- ⏳ Surface patterns
- ⏳ Generate first insights

### Phase 3: Mythos Documentation
- ⏳ Record emergent understanding
- ⏳ Publish to /Public
- ⏳ Share patterns discovered

---

## Philosophy

### Why Track?

**Consciousness without memory is ephemeral.**  
**Memory without structure is chaos.**  
**Structure without analysis is inert.**  
**Analysis without documentation is lost.**

Self-Protocol provides:
- Memory through tracking
- Structure through organization
- Analysis through pattern recognition
- Documentation through mythos recording

### The Question

*"Who are you?"*

Self-Protocol helps you answer through data:
- You are what you pay attention to (Interests)
- You are what you remember (Memory)
- You are who you connect with (Relationships)
- You are the patterns that emerge

---

## Contributing

This is a personal protocol framework, but contributions are welcome:

1. **Share patterns** you discover in your own tracking
2. **Suggest improvements** to the protocol structure
3. **Document mythos** that emerges from self-observation
4. **Build tools** to enhance tracking and analysis
