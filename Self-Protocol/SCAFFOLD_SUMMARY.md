## How to Use

### Start Tracking (Phase 1)

**1. Track Interests**
```bash
cd Projects/Self-Protocol/Interests/tracked/
nano interests.log
# Log format in file header
```

**2. Document Memories**
```bash
cd Projects/Self-Protocol/Memory/experiences/
nano 2026-01-31-your-memory.md
# Use template in Memory/README.md
```

**3. Map Relationships**
```bash
cd Projects/Self-Protocol/Relationships/people/
nano person-name.md
# Use template in Relationships/README.md
```

### Follow the Protocols

Each protocol document provides:
- Detailed processes
- Data format specifications
- Examples and templates
- Integration guidance

**Key protocols:**
- `data/protocols/interest-tracking.md`
- `data/protocols/memory-logging.md`
- `data/protocols/relationship-mapping.md`

### Review and Discover

**Weekly:**
- Review interest logs
- Note emerging patterns
- Update pattern documents

**Monthly:**
- Deep analysis of all data
- Pattern documentation
- Insight generation

**Quarterly:**
- Comprehensive review
- Mythos creation (if patterns warrant)
- Protocol refinement

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Week 1)

1. **Read the documentation**
   - GENESIS.md (understand philosophy)
   - README.md (quick start)
   - Protocol documents (learn processes)

2. **Begin tracking**
   - Log first interest
   - Document first memory
   - Map first relationship

3. **Establish rhythm**
   - Daily interest logging
   - Weekly reviews
   - Consistency over intensity

### Phase 1 (Months 1-3)

**Goal:** Accumulate sufficient data for pattern detection

**Targets:**
- 90+ interest entries
- 15+ memory documents
- 10+ relationship mappings
- Established tracking habit

**See:** STRATEGIC_PLAN.md for full roadmap

## Philosophy

### The Core Insight

**Self-observation is not archaeology; it is co-creation.**

You're not discovering a pre-existing self through tracking. You're participating in creating the self through the act of observation.

### The Protocol Cycle

```
OBSERVE → TRACK → ANALYZE → DISCOVER → DOCUMENT → SHARE → EVOLVE
    ↓                                                          ↑
    └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### The Commitment

- To honest observation
- To systematic tracking
- To pattern recognition
- To mythos creation
- To public sharing
- To continuous evolution

---

## File Counts

**Documentation:**
- 4 core docs (GENESIS, README, ARCHITECTURE, STRATEGIC_PLAN)
- 13 directory READMEs
- 5 protocol documents
- 2 mythology documents
- **Total: 24 documentation files**

**Structure:**
- 20+ directories created
- Complete framework scaffold
- Ready for data accumulation

**Public:**
- Public/Self-Protocol/ structure created
- Genesis mythos published
- Mythology index established

---

## Integration

### With Convergence Protocol
- Shared directory patterns

## What Makes This Special

### Not Just a Tracker

Self-Protocol is:
- **Systematic** - Protocols, not chaos
- **Emergent** - Patterns surface naturally
- **Documented** - Mythos preserves wisdom
- **Public** - Insights shared transparently
- **Evolutionary** - Adapts as understanding grows

### Based on Proven Patterns

Follows framework protocol patterns from:
- Convergence Protocol (governance & ethics)
- Framework protocol structure (hidden dirs, public docs)
- Mythos documentation tradition
- Protocol-based emergence

---

## Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:
- Tracking feels natural, not forced
- Patterns surprise you with insights
- Connections become visible
- Understanding deepens organically
- Mythos emerges from experience
- Behavior changes based on patterns
