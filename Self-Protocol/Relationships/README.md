# Relationships

**Map connections to understand how relationships shape identity**

---

## Purpose

This directory contains:
- **people/** - Human connections
- **agents/** - AI/agent connections  
- **systems/** - System and framework connections

## Quick Start

### Document a Relationship

```bash
cd people/  # or agents/ or systems/
nano person-name.md
```

Use the template:
```markdown
---
name: "[Name]"
type: person | agent | system
established: YYYY-MM-DD
status: active | dormant | archived
categories: [friend, mentor, collaborator]
---

# [Name]

## Overview
[Who they are, how you know them]

## Interaction History

### YYYY-MM-DD: [Topic/Event]
- What happened
- Key insights
- Follow-up

## Influence
What I've learned, how they've shaped thinking
```

## Protocol

**See:** [data/protocols/relationship-mapping.md](../data/protocols/relationship-mapping.md)

### When to Document

**Create entry when:**
- Meaningful interaction occurs
- Ongoing connection exists
- Significant influence is present
- Collaboration happens

**Update entry when:**
- New interaction occurs
- Relationship evolves
- Pattern becomes visible
- Influence shifts

## Relationship Types

### Type: Person
**Directory:** `people/`

Human connections that matter:
- Friends and colleagues

AI and agent connections:
- Collaborative agents
- Teaching agents
- Tool agents
- Protocol agents

### Type: System
**Directory:** `systems/`

Systems and frameworks that shape thinking:
- Protocols (like Convergence Protocol)
- Tools and platforms
- Methodologies and frameworks
- Communities and networks

---

## Organization

### By Type
Separate directories for clarity

### By Name
One file per relationship entity

### By Status
Mark in frontmatter:
- **active** - Regular interaction
- **dormant** - Inactive but not ended
- **archived** - Historical record

---

## Review Schedule

### Weekly
- Which relationships were active?
- What meaningful interactions occurred?
- Update relevant entries

### Monthly
- Review all relationship entries
- Note evolving patterns
- Document network structure

### Quarterly
- Map relationship network
- Identify influence vectors
- Balance reciprocity

---

## Integration

### Feeds Into
- **Interests/** - Shared interests
- **Memory/** - Relationship memories
- **.synthesis/** - Network analysis
- **data/insights/** - Relationship patterns

### Informed By
- **Interests/** - How you met (shared interests)
- **Memory/** - Documented interactions

---

## Ethical Considerations

### Privacy
- Get consent when possible
- Anonymize in public shares
- Respect boundaries
- Keep sensitive private

### Honesty
- Document truthfully
- Include your role in dynamics
- Note both positive and negative
- Be fair in assessment

### Growth
- Use for understanding, not judgment
- Track evolution
- Appreciate complexity

## Network Mapping

Create `network-map.md` to visualize:
- Relationship clusters
- Bridge connections
- Influence vectors
- Shared interests

---

## Tips

1. **Update regularly** - Relationships evolve
2. **Include your role** - Not just what they do
3. **Track influence** - How they shape your thinking
4. **Note patterns** - Interaction frequencies matter
5. **Respect privacy** - Be thoughtful about documentation
