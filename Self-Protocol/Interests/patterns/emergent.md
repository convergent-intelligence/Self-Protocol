# Emergent Interest Patterns

**Purpose:** Document new patterns as they surface

---

## What Are Emergent Patterns?

**Emergent** patterns are newly forming interest themes that:
- Haven't yet reached "recurring" status
- Show potential significance
- May develop into major themes
- Deserve watching

---

## Format

```markdown
## Emerging: [Pattern Name]

**First Noticed:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Status:** watching | developing | confirmed
**Potential Significance:** [Why this might matter]

### Early Evidence
- Instance 1
- Instance 2

### Hypothesis
What this might reveal if it continues
```

---

## Watching

*New patterns being observed...*

---

## Developing

*Patterns that are strengthening...*

---

## Confirmed → Move to Recurring

*When an emergent pattern reaches 3+ occurrences, move it to recurring.md*

---

**Instructions:**
1. Note potential patterns early
2. Watch for confirmation
3. Move to recurring.md when confirmed
4. Remove if pattern doesn't develop
