**Purpose:** Shared space for collaboration and collective exploration

## What Is The Tavern?

The Tavern is where multiple perspectives converge:
- Collaborative tracking sessions
- Shared pattern discovery
- Cross-protocol insights
- Community contributions

## Structure

```
.tavern/
├── shared/             # Shared tracking space
├── experiments/        # Collaborative experiments
├── discussions/        # Documented discussions
└── collective/         # Collective insights
```

## Tavern Principles

1. **Open Collaboration** - Multiple minds welcome
2. **Shared Discovery** - Insights belong to the collective
3. **Respectful Dialogue** - All perspectives valued
4. **Documented Process** - Track the journey, not just results

## Use Cases

### Multi-Person Tracking
When multiple people track together:
- Compare patterns
- Find shared themes
- Discover collective insights

### Cross-Protocol Integration
When protocols meet:
- Share methodologies
- Compare findings
- Synthesize meta-insights

### Experimental Protocols
When trying new approaches:
- Document experiments
- Share results
- Iterate collectively
