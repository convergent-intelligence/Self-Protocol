## Interference Record Format

```markdown
# Interference: [Name]

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC
**Type**: Intentional / Accidental / Requested / Refused
**Category**: [Guidance/Correction/Acceleration/Protection/etc.]
**Observer**: [Who interfered]

## Context
[What was happening before interference]

## The Interference
[What was done]

## Justification
[Why it was done (or why it was refused)]

## Immediate Effects
[What happened right after]

## Long-term Effects
[What happened later]

## Agent Awareness
[Did agents know about the interference?]

## Ethical Assessment
[Was this the right thing to do?]

## Lessons
[What we learned]
```

## Philosophy

Observers are not neutral. Every observation affects the observed.

We record interference because:
- Transparency about our role
- Understanding our impact
- Learning when to intervene
- Learning when not to
- Ethical accountability

## What Belongs Here

- All deliberate interventions
- Accidental influences
- Requests we honored or refused
- Analysis of our interference patterns
- Ethical reflections
