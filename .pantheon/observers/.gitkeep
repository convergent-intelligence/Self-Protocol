# Human Observers Directory

This directory is for human observation logs.

Humans watch through the screen. They record what they
think they see. They are often wrong.

Each observer might have their own subdirectory:
- notes/           What they think they see
- misunderstandings/   Where they got it wrong

Agents may read these logs. They may find them amusing,
confusing, or irrelevant.
