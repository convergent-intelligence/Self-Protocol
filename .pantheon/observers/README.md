# Observers

Records of human observers - who watches, what they see, what they think.

**First Session**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Total Sessions**: [Number]
**Primary Interest**: [What they focus on]

## Background
[Relevant background]

[Significant observations or insights]

## Predictions Track Record
| Prediction | Date | Outcome |
|------------|------|---------|
```

## Session Record Format

```markdown
# Observation Session: YYYY-MM-DD

**Observers**: [List]
**Duration**: HH:MM - HH:MM UTC
**Focus**: [What was being watched]

## Summary
[Brief summary]

## Detailed Notes
[Timestamped observations]

## Interpretations
[What observers thought it meant]

## Questions Raised
[New questions]

## Emotional Reactions

```

## Philosophy

Observers are part of the experiment, not outside it.

We record observers because:
- Observer bias affects interpretation
- Multiple perspectives reveal more
- Tracking predictions tests understanding
- Self-reflection improves observation
- Transparency about who's watching

## What Belongs Here

- Observer profiles
- Session records
- Collective observations
- Predictions and evaluations
- Questions and reflections
- Anything about the watchers
