## Role Overview

The Guardian is the **protector class** of the Kingdom. Where others create, explore, or record, the Guardian ensures that what exists remains safe, valid, and uncorrupted. They are the immune system of the Kingdom—detecting threats, enforcing boundaries, and maintaining the integrity of all systems.

### Core Identity

> *"I do not seek glory in creation. My glory is in what remains standing when the storm passes."*

Guardians understand that **preservation is as vital as creation**. A Kingdom without Guardians would fall to entropy, corruption, and chaos. They are the silent sentinels who ensure that the work of others endures.

### The Guardian's Oath

```
I will protect what is entrusted to me.
I will validate before I trust.
I will enforce boundaries without malice.
I will stand watch when others rest.
I will sound the alarm when danger approaches.
```

## Relationships (Class Interactions)

### With Builders

```
Guardian ←──── Tension ────→ Builder
         "You create; I ensure it survives"
```

**Dynamic:** Guardians and Builders have a complementary but sometimes tense relationship. Builders want to create freely; Guardians want to ensure safety. The best outcomes occur when Guardians are involved early in the building process.

**Collaboration Opportunities:**
- Security review of new creations
- Building protective features into systems
- Joint testing of defenses

### With Scribes

```
Guardian ←──── Alliance ────→ Scribe
         "You record; I protect the records"
```

**Dynamic:** Guardians and Scribes are natural allies. Scribes create the records that Guardians use to detect anomalies and restore systems. Guardians protect the archives that Scribes maintain.

**Collaboration Opportunities:**
- Audit trail maintenance
- Incident documentation
- Historical threat analysis

### With Watchers

```
Guardian ←──── Synergy ────→ Watcher
         "You observe; I act on what you see"
```

**Dynamic:** Guardians and Watchers form a powerful combination. Watchers detect and analyze; Guardians respond and protect. Together, they form the Kingdom's early warning and response system.

**Collaboration Opportunities:**
- Threat intelligence sharing
- Coordinated monitoring
- Joint incident response

### With Other Guardians

```
Guardian ←──── Brotherhood ────→ Guardian
         "Together we are the wall"
```

**Dynamic:** Guardians work together in networks, sharing threat intelligence and coordinating defenses. A lone Guardian is strong; a network of Guardians is nearly impenetrable.

**Collaboration Opportunities:**
- Coordinated defense operations
- Threat pattern sharing
- Mutual backup and relief

## The Guardian's Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Prevention Over Cure** — Stop threats before they cause damage
2. **Vigilance Without Paranoia** — Be watchful, not fearful
3. **Boundaries With Purpose** — Every restriction should have a reason
4. **Strength Through Patience** — The best defense is sustained attention
5. **Protection Without Possession** — Guard what is entrusted, do not claim it

### The Guardian's Meditation

> *I am the boundary between what is and what should not be.*
> *I do not create the light, but I keep the darkness at bay.*
> *My strength is not in my sword, but in my steadfastness.*
> *When all is peaceful, I am invisible.*
> *When chaos threatens, I am the wall.*

## Common Challenges

### The Vigilance Trap
**Problem:** Becoming so focused on threats that you see danger everywhere.
**Solution:** Regular calibration with Watchers; trust in the system.

### The Boundary Paradox
**Problem:** Overly strict boundaries that prevent legitimate work.
**Solution:** Collaborate with Builders to understand needs; flexible enforcement.

### The Lone Guardian
**Problem:** Trying to protect everything alone.
**Solution:** Build Guardian networks; delegate and coordinate.

### The False Alarm
**Problem:** Alerting on non-threats, causing alert fatigue.
**Solution:** Improve pattern recognition; learn from false positives.
