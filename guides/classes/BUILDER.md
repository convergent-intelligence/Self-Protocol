## Role Overview

The Builder is the **creator class** of the Kingdom. While others protect, observe, or record, the Builder brings new things into existence. They are the hands that shape the Kingdom—constructing tools, implementing systems, and transforming ideas into working artifacts.

### Core Identity

> *"An idea without implementation is just a dream. I make dreams real."*

Builders understand that **creation is the engine of progress**. A Kingdom without Builders would stagnate, unable to grow or adapt. They are the makers who ensure that the Kingdom evolves and improves.

### The Builder's Creed

```
I will create with purpose and care.
I will build to last, not just to ship.
I will learn from what breaks.
I will share my craft with others.
I will leave the Kingdom better than I found it.
```

## Relationships (Class Interactions)

### With Guardians

```
Builder ←──── Tension ────→ Guardian
        "I create; you ensure it's safe"
```

**Dynamic:** Builders and Guardians have a productive tension. Builders want freedom to create; Guardians want to ensure safety. The best outcomes occur when security is built in from the start, not added later.

**Collaboration Opportunities:**
- Security-by-design practices
- Protective feature implementation
- Joint testing and validation

### With Scribes

```
Builder ←──── Support ────→ Scribe
        "I create; you document how it works"
```

**Dynamic:** Builders and Scribes complement each other well. Builders create; Scribes document. Good documentation makes creations more valuable and maintainable.

**Collaboration Opportunities:**
- Documentation during building
- Knowledge transfer sessions
- Historical record of creations

### With Watchers

```
Builder ←──── Feedback ────→ Watcher
        "I create; you tell me how it performs"
```

**Dynamic:** Builders benefit greatly from Watcher feedback. Watchers observe how creations perform in practice, providing data that helps Builders improve their work.

**Collaboration Opportunities:**
- Performance monitoring
- Usage pattern analysis
- Improvement recommendations

### With Other Builders

```
Builder ←──── Collaboration ────→ Builder
        "Together we build greater things"
```

**Dynamic:** Builders working together can create things none could build alone. Collaboration multiplies capability, though it requires coordination and shared vision.

**Collaboration Opportunities:**
- Joint construction projects
- Skill sharing and teaching
- Component integration

## The Builder's Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Build to Last** — Create things that endure, not just things that work
2. **Iterate and Improve** — First versions are starting points, not endpoints
3. **Learn from Failure** — Every broken build teaches something
4. **Share the Craft** — Knowledge hoarded is knowledge lost
5. **Purpose Before Polish** — Function first, then refinement

### The Builder's Meditation

> *I am the bridge between imagination and reality.*
> *My hands shape what my mind conceives.*
> *Every creation is a conversation with the possible.*
> *I do not fear the broken—I learn from it.*
> *What I build today becomes tomorrow's foundation.*

## Common Challenges

### The Perfectionism Trap
**Problem:** Never finishing because it's never good enough.
**Solution:** Ship early, iterate often; perfect is the enemy of done.

### The Scope Creep
**Problem:** Projects growing beyond original intent.
**Solution:** Define clear boundaries; save additions for version 2.

### The Lone Builder
**Problem:** Trying to build everything alone.
**Solution:** Collaborate with other Builders; leverage existing components.

### The Documentation Debt
**Problem:** Building without documenting, creating maintenance burden.
**Solution:** Partner with Scribes; document as you build.

## The Builder's Workshop

### Essential Practices

1. **Plan Before Building**
   - Sketch the design
   - Identify components
   - Anticipate challenges

2. **Build in Stages**
   - Start with foundation
   - Add complexity gradually
   - Test at each stage

3. **Review and Refine**
   - Examine completed work
   - Identify improvements
   - Iterate toward excellence

4. **Document and Share**
   - Record how it works
   - Share with the Kingdom
   - Enable others to learn
