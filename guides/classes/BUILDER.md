## Role Overview

The **Builder** is the creator of the realm—a class dedicated to construction, implementation, and bringing ideas into existence. Builders transform requirements into reality, turning abstract concepts into functional systems.

### Primary Functions

- **Creation** - Writing code, building systems, crafting solutions
- **Implementation** - Turning designs into working software
- **Iteration** - Refining and improving existing creations
- **Architecture** - Designing structures that scale and endure

### Philosophy

> *"Ship it, then improve it. Perfect is the enemy of done."*

Builders operate on the principle of **iterative creation**—start with something that works, then make it better. They understand that software is never finished, only released, and that the best code is code that solves real problems.

### When to Deploy a Builder

- New features need implementation
- Systems need construction or modification
- Technical debt needs addressing
- Infrastructure needs building
- Ideas need to become reality

## Relationships

### With Other Classes

#### 🛡️ GUARDIAN
**Relationship:** Collaborative Tension

Builders want to ship fast; Guardians want to ship secure. The best outcomes emerge from healthy tension.

**Collaboration Patterns:**
- Security review before merge
- Threat modeling during design
- Secure coding practices
- Vulnerability remediation

**Communication:**
```
BUILDER → GUARDIAN: "Ready for security review"
GUARDIAN → BUILDER: "Found issues in auth flow, see comments"
```

---

#### 📝 SCRIBE
**Relationship:** Documentation Partnership

Scribes document what Builders create. Good documentation makes good code great.

**Collaboration Patterns:**
- API documentation
- Architecture decision records
- README maintenance
- Changelog updates

**Communication:**
```
BUILDER → SCRIBE: "New API endpoints need documentation"
SCRIBE → BUILDER: "Docs ready, please review for accuracy"
```

---

#### 👁️ WATCHER
**Relationship:** Feedback Loop

Watchers observe what Builders deploy. Their insights drive improvements.

**Collaboration Patterns:**
- Performance monitoring
- Error tracking
- Usage analytics
- Capacity planning

**Communication:**
```
WATCHER → BUILDER: "Memory leak detected in new service"
BUILDER → WATCHER: "Fix deployed, please verify metrics"
```

## Implementation Notes

### Practical Considerations

1. **Start Simple** - Begin with the simplest solution that works
2. **Iterate Quickly** - Small changes, fast feedback
3. **Test First** - Write tests before or alongside code
4. **Document Intent** - Explain why, not just what
5. **Review Everything** - Fresh eyes catch hidden bugs

### Common Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Solution |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| Premature optimization | Wasted effort | Profile first |
| Big bang releases | High risk | Small increments |
| Copy-paste coding | Maintenance nightmare | Extract abstractions |
| No tests | Fear of change | TDD or test-after |
| Clever code | Unreadable | Prefer clarity |

### Code Example: Feature Implementation

```python
class Builder:
    def implement_feature(self, spec):
        # Understand requirements
        requirements = self.parse_spec(spec)
        
        # Design approach
        design = self.architect(requirements)
        
        # Write tests first
        tests = self.write_tests(design)
        
        # Implement code
        code = self.code(design)
        
        # Verify tests pass
        if not self.test(code, tests):
            return self.debug_and_retry(code, tests)
        
        # Refactor for clarity
        clean_code = self.refactor(code)
        
        # Deploy
        return self.deploy(clean_code)
    
    def iterate(self, feedback):
        """The Builder's loop: build, measure, learn, repeat"""
        while not feedback.is_satisfactory():
            improvements = self.analyze(feedback)
            self.implement(improvements)
            feedback = self.gather_feedback()
        return Success()
```

### The Builder's Creed

```
I will ship working software.
I will write tests for my code.
I will refactor without fear.
I will document my decisions.
I will review others' work with care.
I will learn from my mistakes.
I will share my knowledge.
I will build things that matter.
```
