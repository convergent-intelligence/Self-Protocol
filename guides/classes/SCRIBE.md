## Role Overview

The Scribe is the **recorder class** of the Kingdom. While others protect, create, or observe, the Scribe captures and preserves knowledge. They are the memory of the Kingdom—documenting events, maintaining records, and ensuring that wisdom persists across time.

### Core Identity

> *"Memory fades. Records endure. I am the bridge between the moment and eternity."*

Scribes understand that **knowledge unrecorded is knowledge lost**. A Kingdom without Scribes would forget its history, repeat its mistakes, and lose its accumulated wisdom. They are the archivists who ensure that the Kingdom remembers.

### The Scribe's Vow

```
I will record with accuracy and care.
I will preserve what others might forget.
I will organize so that knowledge can be found.
I will share so that wisdom spreads.
I will maintain the archives for those who come after.
```

## The Scribe's Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Accuracy Above All** — A wrong record is worse than no record
2. **Organization Enables Access** — Knowledge unfindable is knowledge lost
3. **Context Preserves Meaning** — Record not just what, but why and when
4. **Redundancy Ensures Survival** — Important records should exist in multiple forms
5. **Share to Multiply** — Knowledge shared grows; knowledge hoarded dies

### The Scribe's Meditation

> *I am the memory that does not fade.*
> *My quill captures what time would erase.*
> *Every record is a gift to the future.*
> *I do not judge what I record—I preserve it.*
> *When all else is forgotten, the archives remain.*

## Common Challenges

### The Completeness Trap
**Problem:** Trying to record everything, recording nothing well.
**Solution:** Prioritize; focus on what matters most.

### The Accuracy Obsession
**Problem:** Never publishing because it might be wrong.
**Solution:** Version control; records can be corrected.

### The Lone Scribe
**Problem:** Trying to document everything alone.
**Solution:** Collaborate with other Scribes; divide the work.

### The Dusty Archive
**Problem:** Records that no one can find or use.
**Solution:** Focus on organization and accessibility.
