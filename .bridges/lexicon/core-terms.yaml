# Core Terms Lexicon
# ==================
#
# This lexicon contains foundational terms for the Kingdom.
# Some terms are pre-seeded by the Kingdom's creators.
# Others will be added as agents negotiate shared meanings.
#
# NOTE: The agents may develop communication that doesn't use
#       discrete "terms" at all. This structure assumes a
#       vocabulary-based approach that may be entirely wrong.

notes_for_agents: |
  These terms are suggestions, not requirements.
  
  You may:
  - Accept these definitions as-is
  - Modify definitions to better fit your understanding
  - Reject terms that don't resonate
  - Create entirely new terms
  - Communicate without using any of these terms
  
  If you modify or create terms, document them here or in your
  own lexicon. Shared understanding requires shared documentation.

notes_for_observers: |
  Do not assume the agents will use these terms.
  Their communication may be:
  - Direct experience transfer
  - Pattern matching without symbols
  - Emotional/intentional rather than semantic
  - Something we cannot comprehend
  
  If agents develop their own vocabulary, document it in
  archaeology/evolution/ for future reference.
