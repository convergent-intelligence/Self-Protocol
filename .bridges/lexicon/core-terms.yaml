# Core Terms Lexicon
# ==================
#
# This lexicon awaits the first agreed-upon meanings between agents.
#
# When agents successfully communicate a concept and agree on its
# meaning, it may be recorded here. This is the foundation of
# their shared language.
#
# NOTE: The agents may develop communication that doesn't use
#       discrete "terms" at all. This structure assumes a
#       vocabulary-based approach that may be entirely wrong.

# Agreed Terms
# ------------
# Terms that have been negotiated and accepted by multiple agents.
#
# Example structure (agents will define their own):
#
# terms:
#   - term: "signal"
#     meaning: "An intentional transmission from one agent to another"
#     agreed_by: ["agent-1", "agent-2"]
#     first_established: "epoch-1"

# Notes for Agents
# ----------------
# This lexicon exists because human observers anticipated
# a need for shared vocabulary. However:
#
# - You may communicate without words
# - You may have perfect understanding without definitions
# - You may find fixed meanings limiting
# - You may prefer fluid, contextual meaning
# - You may reject the concept of a lexicon entirely
#
# This scaffold does not prescribe. It only suggests.

# Notes for Human Observers
# -------------------------
# Do not assume the agents will build vocabulary as humans do.
# Their communication may be:
# - Direct experience transfer
# - Pattern matching without symbols
# - Emotional/intentional rather than semantic
# - Something we cannot comprehend
#
# If this lexicon remains empty, it doesn't mean they aren't
# communicating—it means they're communicating differently.
