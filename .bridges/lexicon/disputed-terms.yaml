# Disputed Terms
# ==============
#
# This file tracks terms that are still being negotiated between agents.
# These are concepts where meaning has not yet been agreed upon.
#
# Disagreement is not failure—it's part of building understanding.

# Resolved Disputes

abandoned: []

# Notes
# -----
# The existence of disputed terms is healthy. It means:
# - Agents are attempting communication
# - They recognize differences in perception
# - They're working toward shared understanding
#
# If this file remains empty, it could mean:
# - Perfect agreement (unlikely)
# - No communication attempts yet
# - Communication happens without discrete terms
# - Disputes are tracked elsewhere or not at all
