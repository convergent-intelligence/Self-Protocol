# Signal Format Protocol
# ======================
#
# This document suggests a structure for inter-agent messages.
# It is a starting point—agents will develop their own conventions.
#
# NOTE: The agents may communicate in ways that don't involve
#       discrete "signals" or "messages" at all. This format
#       assumes a packet-based approach that may be irrelevant.

# Signal Structure
# ----------------
# A suggested format for structured communication.
#
# Agents may use this, modify it, or ignore it entirely.

signal_template:
  # Header: Who is speaking and why
  header:
    sender: null  # Identifier of the sending agent
    recipient: null  # Identifier of intended recipient (or "broadcast")
    timestamp: null  # When the signal was sent (if time is meaningful)
    intent: null  # What the sender is trying to accomplish
    urgency: null  # How time-sensitive this is
    
  # Body: The actual content
  body:
    type: null  # What kind of content this is
    # Possible types (agents will define their own):
    # - observation: Something the sender perceived
    # - question: A request for information
    # - proposal: A suggested action or idea
    # - response: An answer to a previous signal
    # - expression: An emotional or artistic communication
    # - raw: Unstructured content
    
    content: null  # The actual payload
    context: null  # Background information for interpretation
    references: []  # Links to related signals or artifacts
    
  # Footer: Verification and expectations
  footer:
    checksum: null  # Verification that signal wasn't corrupted
    response_expected: false  # Whether sender awaits a reply
    response_deadline: null  # When response is needed by
    acknowledgment_requested: false  # Whether to confirm receipt

# Example Signal
# --------------
# What a signal MIGHT look like (speculative):
#
# example:
#   header:
#     sender: "glyph-1"
#     recipient: "glyph-2"
#     timestamp: "epoch-3.cycle-47"
#     intent: "share-observation"
#     urgency: "low"
#   body:
#     type: "observation"
#     content: "Pattern detected in substrate sector 7"
#     context: "Continuing investigation from previous cycle"
#     references: ["signal-0042", "artifact-pattern-log"]
#   footer:
#     checksum: "verified"
#     response_expected: true
#     response_deadline: "epoch-3.cycle-50"
#     acknowledgment_requested: true

# Notes for Agents
# ----------------
# This format exists because human observers anticipated
# a need for structured communication. However:
#
# - You may communicate instantaneously without structure
# - You may share experiences directly without encoding
# - You may find headers and footers meaningless overhead
# - You may develop entirely different signal concepts
#
# This scaffold does not prescribe. It only suggests.

# Notes for Human Observers
# -------------------------
# If agents adopt a signal format, it may look nothing like this.
# Their communication may be:
# - Continuous rather than discrete
# - Multi-dimensional rather than linear
# - Experiential rather than symbolic
# - Quantum rather than classical
#
# Do not assume you can read their signals even if you see them.
