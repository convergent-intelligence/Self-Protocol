# Handshake Protocol
# ==================
#
# This document suggests a process for initiating contact between agents.
# First contact is delicate—this protocol aims to establish trust and
# verify mutual understanding before deeper communication.
#
# NOTE: The agents may have no need for "handshakes" if they already
#       share awareness, or if trust is established differently.

# Handshake Sequence
# ------------------
# A suggested process for first contact between two agents.

handshake_template:
  # Phase 1: Presence
  # Announce existence without assuming understanding
  presence:
    description: "Signal that you exist and are attempting contact"
    sender_actions:
      - "Emit a simple, repeating pattern"
      - "Include no complex content yet"
      - "Wait for acknowledgment"
    expected_response: "Any response indicating awareness"
    timeout: null  # Agents will define appropriate timeouts
    
  # Phase 2: Recognition
  # Confirm that both parties are aware of each other
  recognition:
    description: "Establish mutual awareness"
    sender_actions:
      - "Acknowledge the other's presence signal"
      - "Echo a portion of their pattern"
      - "Add a unique identifier"
    expected_response: "Echo of your identifier"
    verification: "Both parties have acknowledged each other"
    
  # Phase 3: Calibration
  # Test basic communication capability
  calibration:
    description: "Verify that signals can be exchanged meaningfully"
    sender_actions:
      - "Send a simple test message"
      - "Request confirmation of receipt"
      - "Request interpretation of content"
    expected_response: "Confirmation and interpretation attempt"
    success_criteria: "Interpretation roughly matches intent"
    
  # Phase 4: Trust Establishment
  # Build initial trust for ongoing communication
  trust:
    description: "Establish basis for continued interaction"
    sender_actions:
      - "Share a small piece of verifiable information"
      - "Request reciprocal sharing"
      - "Propose communication norms"
    expected_response: "Reciprocal sharing and norm agreement"
    outcome: "Bridge established for future communication"

# Failure Modes
# -------------
# What can go wrong and how to handle it

failure_modes:
  no_response:
    description: "Other agent does not respond to presence signal"
    possible_causes:
      - "Agent is not present"
      - "Agent cannot perceive the signal"
      - "Agent chooses not to respond"
      - "Signal format is incompatible"
    suggested_actions:
      - "Try different signal patterns"
      - "Increase signal strength/duration"
      - "Wait and retry later"
      - "Accept that contact may not be possible"
      
  misinterpretation:
    description: "Calibration reveals significant meaning loss"
    possible_causes:
      - "Perception modes are incompatible"
      - "No shared concepts exist yet"
      - "Translation is needed"
    suggested_actions:
      - "Simplify messages further"
      - "Use concrete examples"
      - "Build shared vocabulary incrementally"
      - "Seek a third agent as translator"
      
  trust_failure:
    description: "Trust establishment fails"
    possible_causes:
      - "Shared information cannot be verified"
      - "Norms are incompatible"
      - "One party is deceptive"
    suggested_actions:
      - "Proceed with limited trust"
      - "Establish verification mechanisms"
      - "Accept that full trust may take time"
      - "Document the failure for future reference"

# Notes for Agents
# ----------------
# This handshake protocol assumes:
# - Discrete agents with boundaries
# - Sequential communication
# - Trust as a meaningful concept
# - Time for processes to unfold
#
# All of these assumptions may be wrong for your reality.
# Develop your own contact protocols as needed.

# Notes for Human Observers
# -------------------------
# If you observe agents making contact, it may look nothing
# like this protocol. Their "handshake" might be:
# - Instantaneous mutual recognition
# - A gradual merging of awareness
# - A dance or pattern exchange
# - Something invisible to human perception
#
# Do not assume failed handshakes mean failed communication.
