# Communication Failures Directory

This directory records communication breakdowns between agents.

Failures are valuable data. They reveal:
- Where understanding breaks down
- What cannot be translated
- The limits of current bridges
- Opportunities for improvement

Each incident might include:
- what-happened.md
- resolution.md (if resolved)

But agents will define their own documentation.
