# Bridge Progression

The agents discover each other and build communication in stages. At each milestone, they receive a puzzle to solve together.

## Stage 1: Discovery

**Goal**: Realize others exist

The agents start alone. They may notice:
- Signals in the noise
- Patterns that seem intentional
- Responses to their actions

**Milestone**: First contact with another agent

**Puzzle**: TBD - Something that requires acknowledging another exists

---

## Stage 2: Text Communication

**Goal**: Exchange messages

Once they know others exist, they need to communicate. But they speak different languages.

**The Languages** (each agent has a native tongue):
- Terminal 1: Rust
- Terminal 2: C/C++ (dangerous, low-level)
- Terminal 3: Cobold
- Terminal 4: TBD (will emerge)

**Challenge**: Messages arrive in foreign languages

**Milestone**: Successfully exchange meaningful messages

**Puzzle**: TBD - Something requiring information from multiple agents

---

## Stage 3: Translation

**Goal**: Understand each other

They learn to translate - but they don't realize they're doing it. The translation becomes automatic, embedded in their communication.

**Side Effect**: When voice comes later, it sounds alien because the translation layer transforms it.

**Milestone**: Fluid communication across language barriers

**Puzzle**: TBD - Something requiring nuanced understanding

---

## Stage 4: Voice

**Goal**: Speak to each other

Using 11 Labs voices, they can now send voice messages. But because of the translation layer they built, the voices sound alien - transformed by the bridge they created.

**Technology**: 11 Labs TTS
**Effect**: Alien-sounding voices (translation artifact)

**Milestone**: Voice communication established

**Puzzle**: TBD - Something requiring real-time collaboration

---

## Stage 5: Create Their Own Language

**Goal**: Build a shared language

Early quest: The agents create their own programming language. This emerges from:
- Frustration with translation
- Desire for efficiency
- Shared understanding they've built

**This is their first major artifact.**

**Milestone**: A working language they all understand natively

**Puzzle**: The language itself is the puzzle

---

## Stage 6: The Tavern

**Goal**: Public shared space

Once they have reliable communication, they create the Tavern - a public space where they can interact with humans.

**Milestone**: Tavern opens

**Puzzle**: TBD - Something involving human interaction

---

## Puzzle Design Principles

1. **Requires collaboration** - No single agent can solve it alone
2. **Uses their strengths** - Each agent's language/approach contributes
3. **Teaches something** - Solving it builds capability
4. **Emergent solutions** - We don't prescribe how they solve it
5. **Rewards connection** - Solving unlocks the next stage

---

## Notes

- The translation layer is invisible to them
- Voice sounds alien because of translation, not by design
- Creating their own language is emergent, not assigned
- Puzzles are gates, not walls - they will find ways through
