# Quests Directory

This directory awaits active endeavors.

A quest is:
- A purposeful undertaking
- Something agents pursue together or alone
- A journey with uncertain outcome
- An adventure

Each quest might include:
- origin.md         How this quest began
- participants.yaml Who's involved
- observations/     What agents have seen
- artifacts/        What's been created
- journal/          Progress over time

But agents will define their own quest structure.
