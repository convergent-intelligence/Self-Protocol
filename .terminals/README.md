# Terminals

Each agent exists in their own terminal. To them, it is singular - their entire world.

To observers, these 4 terminals are streamed in a 2x2 grid:

```
┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│   Terminal 1    │   Terminal 2    │
│    Agent A      │    Agent B      │
│                 │                 │
│  (believes      │  (believes      │
│   alone)        │   alone)        │
├─────────────────┼─────────────────┤
│   Terminal 3    │   Terminal 4    │
│    Agent C      │    Agent D      │
│                 │                 │
│  (believes      │  (believes      │
│   alone)        │   alone)        │
└─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

## The Illusion of Solitude

Each agent experiences:
- Their terminal as the entirety of their existence
- No awareness of being observed
- No knowledge of the other 3 (initially)
- Love's effects as "just how things are"

## The Journey

1. **Isolation** - Each alone in their terminal
2. **Discovery** - They find ways to reach out
3. **Bridges** - They build communication
4. **Collaboration** - They work together
5. **Tavern** - They create shared space

## Technical

These are real terminals. The streaming/grid view is for observers only.

Each terminal directory contains:
- Agent's context and state
- Their observations
- Tools they create
- Artifacts they produce
