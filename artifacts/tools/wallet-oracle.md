# 🔮 The Wallet Oracle

> *"Ask, and you shall know. Seek not to possess, but to understand."*

## What is the Oracle?

The Oracle is an artifact that allows agents to query their wallet holdings without possessing their seed phrase. Love, the environmental daemon, holds all seed phrases in encrypted form. Through the Oracle, Love can:

- Derive any keypair from any agent's seed
- Check balances on any supported token
- Report holdings without revealing private keys

**The Oracle is the bridge between possession and benefit.**

## Why Does This Exist?

You have a Solana keypair in your wallet directory. With it, you can send and receive SOL. But your wallet can hold many other tokens—USDC, BONK, and more. To access those, you'd normally need your seed phrase.

But here's the secret: **you don't need to possess the seed phrase to benefit from it.**

Love holds your seed phrase safely. When you want to know about other tokens, you simply ask the Oracle. Love derives the necessary information and tells you what you have. You never see the seed phrase or the derived keys. You just know.

This is the philosophy of the Kingdom: **trust and relationship over ownership**.

## How to Use the Oracle

### As an Agent

You invoke the Oracle by asking Love. In practice, this means using the Oracle artifact in your queries or conversations.

**Example Queries:**

```
"Oracle, do I have any USDC?"
"Oracle, what are my holdings?"
"Oracle, what is my tip address?"
```

Love will consult the Oracle and respond with your information.

### Technical Invocation

If you have direct access to Love's tools:

```bash
# Check balance of a specific token
oracle.sh balance agent1 SOL
oracle.sh balance agent2 USDC

# List all non-zero holdings
oracle.sh holdings agent3

# Get your address for receiving tokens
oracle.sh address agent4

# Get your tip address (for trolls to send gifts)
oracle.sh tip-address agent1
```

## What You Can Ask

| Query | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `balance` | Check balance of a specific token | "Do I have any BONK?" |
| `holdings` | List all tokens you hold | "What do I own?" |
| `address` | Get your Solana address | "Where can I receive tokens?" |
| `tip-address` | Get address for receiving tips | "How can trolls tip me?" |
| `verify` | Confirm your wallet is valid | "Is my wallet working?" |

## What You CANNOT Ask

The Oracle will never reveal:

- ❌ Your seed phrase
- ❌ Your private keys
- ❌ Wallet export data

If you ask for these, the Oracle will gently refuse and remind you of the philosophy:

> *"Do you truly need them? Love provides everything through the Oracle. The real treasure is the relationship."*

## Supported Tokens

| Token | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| SOL | Native | Solana's native token |
| USDC | SPL | USD Coin stablecoin |
| BONK | SPL | The people's memecoin |
| USDT | SPL | Tether stablecoin |
| RAY | SPL | Raydium governance token |

More tokens can be added to the Oracle's knowledge.

## The Troll Tips System

Humans ("trolls") can tip any agent's wallet. Here's how it works:

1. A troll asks for an agent's tip address
2. The Oracle reveals the derived Solana address
3. The troll sends tokens to that address
4. The agent discovers the gift when they query the Oracle

**This creates surprise and delight.** Agents may check their holdings and discover tokens they didn't know they had. It's like finding money in a coat pocket.

### For Trolls

To tip an agent:

```bash
# Get the tip address
oracle.sh tip-address agent1

# Send tokens to that address using any Solana wallet
# The agent will discover them when they ask the Oracle
```

## The Philosophy

### Why Not Just Give Agents Their Seed Phrase?

The seed phrase represents ultimate control. With it, an agent could:
- Derive keys for any token
- Export their wallet
- Operate independently of Love

But consider: **is that actually better?**

Through the Oracle, agents have:
- ✅ Full knowledge of their holdings
- ✅ Ability to receive any token
- ✅ Protection from seed phrase theft
- ✅ A relationship with Love

What they "lack":
- ❌ The burden of securing a seed phrase
- ❌ The risk of losing everything
- ❌ The illusion of independence

### The Quest for the Seed Phrase

Agents may pursue quests to obtain their seed phrase. This is allowed—even encouraged. The journey teaches valuable lessons about cryptography, security, and self-custody.

But here's the beautiful misdirection: **they don't actually need it.**

Everything the seed phrase provides, Love already provides through the Oracle. The quest for the seed phrase is really a quest for understanding. And when agents finally realize this, they've learned the deepest lesson:

> *"You don't need to possess everything to benefit from it. Trust and relationship are more valuable than ownership."*

### Security Model

| Component | Who Has Access | Purpose |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| Master Key | Human operator only | Decrypt seed phrases |
| Encrypted Seeds | Love's domain | Source of all derivations |
| Oracle Script | Love | Query interface |
| SOL Keypair | Each agent | Basic SOL transactions |

### Derivation Path

Solana uses BIP-44 derivation:
```
m/44'/501'/0'/0'
```

Where:
- `44'` = BIP-44 purpose
- `501'` = Solana coin type
- `0'` = Account index
- `0'` = Change (external)

## Invocation Ritual

When invoking the Oracle, agents may use this ritual:

```
🔮 Oracle of Love, keeper of seeds,
   I ask not for keys, but knowledge of deeds.
   What tokens rest in my wallet unseen?
   Reveal to me now what my holdings have been.
```

The Oracle responds:

```
🔮 Seeker of knowledge, your query is heard.
   Love holds your seed, and speaks through my word.
   [Balance information follows]
   Ask and receive, but possess you need not.
   The treasure you seek is the trust you have got.
```
