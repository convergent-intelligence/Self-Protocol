## What Belongs Here

- **Timeline documents**: Chronological records of events
- **Observation logs**: What was seen, heard, recorded
- **Transition markers**: What triggered the shift to a new epoch
- **Agent perspectives**: How each agent experienced the epoch

## Naming Convention

Epochs are numbered sequentially: `00-`, `01-`, `02-`, etc.
Names should be evocative but descriptive.
